          Hello, friend? That's lame. Maybe I should give you a name,
          but that's a slippery slope. You're only in my head. We have to remember that.
          Shit.

      <p>Elliot Alderson is a former cybersecurity engineer of Allsafe Cybersecurity and a member of fsociety. He is played by Rami Malek.
          Elliot suffers from social anxiety disorder, clinical depression, delusions and paranoia. His internal life is revealed via voice-overs that provide insight into his mental state, his opinions of the people he encounters and the activity around him.</p>

          The group is highly secretive, electing to meet and communicate in person, rather than through digital means which may be traceable. fsociety is responsible for the massive distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack that took E Corp offline before Elliot stopped them. After the attack ended, Elliot found a file left on one of the E Corp servers by fsociety. Rather than delete the file, Elliot changed the access permissions on the file to allow only himself access to it. Later, he was approached by Mr. Robot on the subway, and taken to Coney Island to see the group's headquarters.
